# Development Log - AI Story Weaver Upgrade (v2)

## Date: August 23, 2025

## Summary of Changes:

This log details the implementation of the "Advanced Scene Mode" (v2) feature, significantly enhancing the AI Story Weaver application's capability to generate and inject detailed 18+ scenes.

### 1. Implemented "Advanced Scene Mode" User Interface (UI)
- **File:** `components/AdvancedSceneMode.tsx`
- **Description:** Created a new React component to serve as the primary interface for the advanced scene generation. This UI includes:
    - Checkboxes for `Anonymous/Threesome Scenario`, `Explicit Dialogue`, and `Audio Description`.
    - Dropdowns for `Writing Mode`, `Partner Type`, `Scene Framework`, and `Deepening Dynamics`.
    - Text inputs for `Setting`, `Focus Keywords`, and `Avoid Keywords`.
    - A series of large text areas for "Building Blocks" (e.g., `User Customization Layer #1`, `Base Character Input`, `Authority Statement`, `Body Control`, `Sensory Details`, `Dialogue`, `Climax`, `Aftermath`), allowing granular control over scene elements.
- **Impact:** Provides users with a highly detailed and customizable interface for generating specific 18+ content.

### 2. Updated Type Definitions
- **File:** `types.ts`
- **Description:** Modified the application's type definitions to accommodate the new advanced configuration:
    - Introduced `AdvancedGenerationConfig` interface, encompassing all parameters of the new UI.
    - Defined new enums: `WritingMode`, `PartnerType`, `SceneFramework`, and `DeepeningDynamics` to provide structured options for the new dropdowns.
    - Updated the `GenerationConfig` type to be a union (`GenerationConfigV1 | AdvancedGenerationConfig`), allowing the application to handle both the original (V1) and the new advanced (V2) configurations.
    - Modified `StorySegment` to reflect the updated `GenerationConfig` type for its `config` property.
- **Impact:** Ensures type safety and proper data structuring for the new advanced generation parameters throughout the application.

### 3. Integrated Advanced Scene Mode into Main Application
- **File:** `App.tsx`
- **Description:** Refactored the main application component to incorporate and manage the new advanced mode:
    - Replaced the `ContentNavigator` component in the main sidebar with `AdvancedSceneMode` when the V2 mode is active.
    - Implemented a UI toggle (buttons "Cơ bản" and "Nâng cao (v2)") to allow users to switch between the original basic configuration and the new advanced mode.
    - Updated the regeneration modal logic to dynamically render either the `ContentNavigator` (for V1 configs) or `AdvancedSceneMode` (for V2 configs) based on the `version` property within the `config` of the `regeneratingSegment`.
    - Managed separate `useState` hooks for `configV1` and `configV2` to maintain distinct configurations for each mode.
- **Impact:** Seamlessly integrates the new feature into the existing application flow, providing users with a choice of generation complexity.

### 4. Enhanced Backend Logic for Prompt Construction
- **File:** `services/geminiService.ts`
- **Description:** Updated the service responsible for interacting with the Gemini API:
    - Introduced a `buildPrompt` helper function that intelligently constructs the API prompt. This function checks the `version` property of the `GenerationConfig` object.
    - For V1 configurations, it generates the original, simpler prompt.
    - For V2 configurations, it generates a highly detailed and structured prompt, incorporating all parameters and "building block" content from `AdvancedGenerationConfig`. This prompt is designed to guide the AI precisely according to user specifications.
    - Updated the `generateStorySegment` function to utilize the new `buildPrompt` function, ensuring the correct prompt is sent to the AI based on the active configuration mode.
    - Added more specific error handling for API calls, including a message for content blocked by safety filters.
- **Impact:** Enables the AI to generate content that adheres strictly to the complex and granular instructions provided by the "Advanced Scene Mode."

### 5. Implemented Import/Export Configuration (JSON)
- **File:** `App.tsx`, `components/AdvancedSceneMode.tsx`
- **Description:** Added functionality for users to save and load their advanced scene configurations:
    - Integrated "Export JSON" and "Import JSON" buttons into the `AdvancedSceneMode` UI.
    - Implemented `handleExportConfig` in `App.tsx` to serialize the current `configV1` or `configV2` state into a JSON string and trigger a file download.
    - Implemented `handleImportConfig` in `App.tsx` to handle file selection, parse the JSON content, and apply it to the appropriate configuration state (`configV1` or `configV2`).
    - **Crucially, implemented robust validation (`validateAdvancedConfig` helper function) for imported V2 configurations.** This validation checks:
        - If the file is valid JSON and an object.
        - The presence of all required fields defined in `AdvancedGenerationConfig`.
        - The correct data type (boolean, string) for each field.
        - That enum fields contain valid, predefined values.
    - Provided specific, user-friendly error messages for various validation failures (e.g., missing fields, invalid values, incorrect format).
- **Impact:** Enhances user flexibility by allowing them to save, share, and reuse complex scene setups, improving workflow efficiency and consistency. The robust validation prevents application crashes due to malformed or incomplete imported configurations.

## Next Steps:
- Thorough testing of all new features, especially prompt generation and import/export validation.
- Refinement of UI/UX based on user feedback.
- Consideration of further enhancements to the prompt structure or AI model parameters.
